        "\n",
        "This assignment explores how large language models (LLMs) can perform complex tasks that previously required coding. Instead of manually writing code, we will interact with Google's Gemini (Click on the Gemini icon on the top right corner) in Google Colab to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and analyze stock price data.\n",
        "- Engineer relevant features for prediction.\n",
        "- Build and evaluate models such as regression and random forest.\n",
        "- Discuss potential trading strategies based on predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: While this notebook contains example code, students are encouraged to use LLMs to generate code snippets and explanations, managing interactions within the LLM's context window.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task Breakdown\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Data Exploration\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Load historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-01-01 using Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "- **Key Considerations**: Ensure the model retains context while summarizing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Feature Engineering\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Generate meaningful features such as moving averages, technical indicators, and volatility measures.\n",
        "- **Managing Context**: If the LLM forgets prior outputs, remind it by reintroducing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Model Building\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Train a model (regression for price prediction, random forest for trend classification).\n",
        "- **Split Ratio Consideration**: Explain the importance of train-test split (e.g., 70/30) and verify the LLM respects it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Model Evaluation & Prediction\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Use the trained model to predict stock prices for 2023-2024.\n",
        "- **Analyze Performance**: Interpret accuracy, R² scores, and classification reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Strategy Discussion\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Based on model performance, discuss possible trading strategies.\n",
        "- **Critical Thinking**: Evaluate whether the model is truly useful for financial decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the assignment, keep in mind that LLMs have a limited context window. If necessary, break down tasks into smaller chunks and reintroduce critical information.\n",

        "Based on the evaluation of the Random Forest classification model on the prediction data from 2023-01-01 to 2024-01-01:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Performance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 50%, which is close to random chance. The classification report revealed that the model is better at identifying days when the stock price is *not* likely to increase (high recall for class 0: 0.93) but struggles significantly to predict days when the price *will* increase (low recall for class 1: 0.16). While the precision for class 1 is higher (0.74), the low recall means it rarely makes a correct positive prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the model is not reliable for predicting upward price movements and its overall performance is not sufficient for making confident trading decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Trading Strategies (with significant caution):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the model's limitations, any trading strategy based on its predictions would be highly risky. Theoretical strategies, acknowledging these limitations, could include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Conservative \"Avoid Downside\" Strategy:** Focus on using the model's relatively higher recall for predicting no price increase (class 0) to potentially avoid buying or consider selling on those days. This aims to mitigate losses but would result in missed opportunities due to the lower precision for this class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Extremely Cautious \"High Precision Buy\" Strategy:** A highly speculative approach could be to only consider buying when the model predicts a price increase (class 1) with a very high probability threshold. This strategy would yield very few trades due to the low recall for class 1 and still carries substantial risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Critical Considerations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis reinforces the difficulty of stock price prediction. The simple features and model used are not adequate to capture market complexities. Relying on a model with this performance for real-world trading is not advisable and could lead to significant financial losses. Improving the model would require exploring more advanced techniques, incorporating a broader range of features (including external economic and market indicators), and conducting rigorous backtesting and validation."
